            <h1> Jump Move</h1>
            <p>If one of your opponent’s checkers is on a forward diagonal next to one of your checkers, and the next space
                beyond the opponent’s checker is empty, then your checker must jump the opponent’s checker and land in
                the space beyond. Your opponent’s checker is captured and removed from the board.
            </p>

            <p>After making one jump, your checker might have another jump available from its new position. Your checker
                must take that jump too. It must continue to jump until there are no more jumps available. Both men and
                kings are allowed to make multiple jumps.
            </p>

            <p>If, at the start of a turn, more than one of your checkers has a jump available, then you may decide
                which one you will move. But once you have chosen one, it must take all the jumps that it can.
            </p>

            <h1>Move Rule</h1>
            <p>Moves are allowed only on the dark squares, so pieces always move diagonally. Single pieces are always limited
                to forward moves (toward the opponent). A piece making a non-capturing move (not involving a jump) may move only one square.
                A piece making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the opponent's pieces, landing in a straight
                diagonal line on the other side. Only one piece may be captured in a single jump; however, multiple jumps are
                allowed during a single turn.
            </p>

            <h1>Capturing Opponent's Piece</h1>
            <p>When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board. If a player is able to make a capture, there is no option; the jump must be made. If more than one capture is available,
                the player is free to choose whichever he or she prefers.
            </p>

            <h1>King Piece</h1>
            <p>When a piece reaches the furthest row from the player who controls that piece, it is crowned and becomes a king.
                One of the pieces which had been captured is placed on top of the king so that it is twice as high as a single piece.
                Kings are limited to moving diagonally but may move both forward and backward. (Remember that single pieces, i.e. non-kings,
                are always limited to forward moves.)Kings may combine jumps in several directions, forward and backward, on the same turn.
                Single pieces may shift direction diagonally during a multiple capture turn, but must always jump forward (toward the opponent).</p>
